### 1.htcondor_patched: ###
install a patched version of HTCondor from private repo.
It is necessary to avoid a bug that prevents resources to be Uncalimed 
in the MPI case. The corresponding image should be made available in DockerHub.

### 2.base_image: ###
here we install packages, including OpenMPI.
Mind that one should install an MPI version corresponding to the right architecture
 on which the image will run (this is sooo not Docker-like... but we need it for HPC).

### 3.occam_image: ###
here we configure HTCondor and other stuff for OCCAM.
